### Replace These Unicode symbols with more common and easy-to-deal-with punctuation marks  

Using Unicode variants of common characters makes management and search tasks more challenging due to the characters looking similar to their common counterparts.  

When copying/harvesting data or source code there is a risk that some characters are not what you expect.  When you save or reuse these inputs in your own work, converting some common Unicode characters to their ASCII counterparts can reduce coding, debugging, testing and risk managment investments.  It can also reduce the potential confusion/frustration of those who use your outputs.  

ToDo: Write a couple scripts to identify and convert the Unicode characters in the table below.  Script inputs: One or more files.  A stream passed along in a pipeline. Script outputs: One or more files or a stream (standard out).
