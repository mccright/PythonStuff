# Generate Candidate Powerball and Mega-Millions Plays  


This script was just an exercise in response to a query by a relative.  
It is not unique. There are other scripts available on Github and elsewhere.  
If you want something like this, maybe try writing your own.  

This script spits out sets of numbers matching the rules for [Powerball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerball) and 
[Mega-Millions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Millions) games.  
It uses the Python module ```secrets``` to generate values having 
maximum entropy (think '*random*') which are then used to assemble each play.  
No need to think about your numbers, nor worry about the Lottery empire 
or someone else generating your numbers for you.  

## Some of the programming challenges in this exercise  
* Accepting user's command line input specifying the number of plays (default to one).  
* Set a *sane* maximum number of plays to help protect system resources (e.g., using the script to generate 2 billion plays would, under most circumstances, be unproductive and should be resisted).  
* Specify the universe of candidate integers for each grouping that makes up a Powerball or Mega-Millions game play.  
* With a *reasonable* level of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)), "randomly" select numbers from the "universes" specified above for each Powerball or Mega-Millions game play.  
* Ensure that there are no duplicates in the "first five" grouping.  
* Sort the "first five" grouping low to high.  
* Present the final Powerball or Mega-Millions game play on the terminal.  
* "Catch" and handle exceptions where *needed*.

### Example Output  
```terminal
user@LT01:/mnt/dev/lottery_numbers$ python3 PowerBall-MegaMillions.py --help
usage: PowerBall-MegaMillions.py [-h] [-n NUM_PLAYS]

Generate candidate Powerball and Mega-Millions plays

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n NUM_PLAYS, --num_plays NUM_PLAYS
                        Generate this many candidate Powerball and Mega-Millions plays

### There is also a way to do this on the bash shell command line:  
[shuf](https://www.mankier.com/1/shuf) does the heavy lifting in our one-liner.  And this old StackOverflow answer by Dan Fego was also helpful for dealing with shuf output: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8714446  
```terminal
$ echo -n "Powerball: " && shuf -i 1-69 -n 5 |  awk -vORS=' ' '{ print $1 }' && echo -n '- ' && shuf -i 1-26 -n 1
Powerball: 67 17 25 21 68 - 7
$ echo -n "Mega-Millions: " && shuf -i 1-70 -n 5 |  awk -vORS=' ' '{ print $1 }' && echo -n '- ' && shuf -i 1-25 -n 1
Mega-Millions: 37 43 58 31 34 - 4
```
or simply:  
```terminal
echo -n "Powerball: " && shuf -i 1-69 -n 5 |  awk -vORS=' ' '{ print $1 }' && echo -n '- ' && shuf -i 1-26 -n 1 && echo -n "Mega-Millions: " && shuf -i 1-70 -n 5 |  awk -vORS=' ' '{ print $1 }' && echo -n '- ' && shuf -i 1-25 -n 1
Powerball: 19 27 29 50 30 - 3
Mega-Millions: 20 61 70 49 38 - 11
```
Wrap that code in a conditional to ensure we receive user input -- an ```if; then``` and ```for (<a positive integer>)``` and then the one-liner above ```else; tell the user how to use the script```  
[lottery_numbers.sh](lottery_numbers.sh).  


## Reference  
Powerball and Mega-Millions are played by selecting six numbers.  
Powerball:     Five numbers between 1-69 and one “Powerball” number between 1-26.  
Mega-Millions: Five numbers between 1-70 and one “Mega Ball” number between 1-25.  

See [Powerball](https://www.usamega.com/powerball/faq) and 
[Mega-Millions](https://www.usamega.com/mega-millions/faq) FAQs for more information.  

Each play is $2.00 (*and have options that have their own additional costs*)  

## Caution  
REMEMBER: **The odds are not in your favor**. You are gambling when you buy tickets and there is no guarantee you'll win any money. Playing the lottery is only entertainment.
