# Get Accurate time from NTP Servers  

* [ntp.py](https://github.com/mccright/PythonStuff/blob/main/ntpTime/ntp.py) will [fetch accurate time from pool.ntp.org](https://github.com/mccright/PythonStuff/tree/main/ntpTime) for validating/sanity-checking ```time``` in your current context.  This is nothing unique -- there are thousands of projects on Github alone that do something like this.  I generally use this idiom for timestamps that MUST be as accurate as is practical when troubleshooting or documenting activities in risk management research.  

[pool.ntp.org](https://www.ntppool.org/zone) is an extremely valuable resource, so don't abuse it.  If you need an ntp source for frequently fetching trusted time consider [setting up your own ntp server](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+create+an+ntp+server&t=h_&ia=web) [*[Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/windows-time-service/windows-time-service-tools-and-settings?tabs=config) and [Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/14558/how-do-i-setup-a-local-ntp-server) examples*) and have it sync with pool.ntp.org, then have your host sync with that, and then get time from your local environment.  If that is impractical (*for example, if your software will be running on lots of locally managed hosts*), then fetch time from own ntp server.  What constitutes *too frequently*?  [Bj√∏rn Hansen](https://www.askask.com/), who runs pool.ntp.org, [says that](https://www.ntppool.org/en/vendors.html) "Reasonable query intervals are typically from once or twice a day to a 4-5 times an hour depending on the application. Really consider how often the device will need *fresh time*. A standard ntpd or openntpd server works, too."  

If you are deciding to set up your own NTP timesource, consider joining pool.ntp.org -- see: https://www.ntppool.org/join.html  

Modern general purpose operating systems all have some kind of [Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntpd).  Ensuring that your standard endpoint setup configures and starts that *ntpd* seems like a baseline quality goal that should be monitored and show up in your periodic operations & security quality reporting.  That will also make it easy for you and those you serve to get reasonably accurate time at a reasonable confidence level.  

Use of [pool.ntp.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTP_pool) from inside your organization may be policy-inappropriate or or it may be inaccessible ([NTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) may be blocked at your network perimeter.  In that case, your organization may have an "internal" NTP server.  If so, replace "pool.ntp.org" with your trusted server.
